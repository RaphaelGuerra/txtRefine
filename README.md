# txtRefine: Philosophy Text Fixer ü§ñüìö

Hey there! üëã Want to know what this program does? It's like having a super-smart friend who helps clean up messy philosophy texts written in Portuguese. Think of it as a "spell checker" but specifically for philosophy terms and names!

## What It Does

Imagine you're reading a philosophy book in Portuguese, and some names are misspelled or written in weird ways. This program automatically finds and fixes those mistakes! For example:

- `Socr√°tes` ‚Üí `S√≥crates`
- `aristoteles` ‚Üí `Arist√≥teles`
- `plat√£o` ‚Üí `Plat√£o`
- `tom√°s de aquino` ‚Üí `Tom√°s de Aquino`

It knows hundreds of philosophy terms, from ancient Greek thinkers to modern Brazilian philosophers, and fixes them while keeping the rest of your text exactly the same.

## Why It's Cool

‚ú® **Super Fast**: Can process long texts in seconds
‚ú® **Smart**: Uses special algorithms to find patterns without getting confused
‚ú® **Memory**: Remembers what it's fixed before, so it gets even faster over time
‚ú® **Brazilian**: Specially designed for Portuguese philosophy texts

## How It Works (Simple Version)

1. You give it a messy text file with philosophy content
2. It scans through looking for misspelled names and terms
3. It fixes them automatically and shows you what changed
4. You get a clean, corrected version to read or study from

Think of it like autocorrect for your phone, but instead of fixing "teh" to "the", it fixes "socratez" to "S√≥crates"!

## Quick Start

Want to try it? Just run the main program and follow the prompts. It's designed to be easy - no complicated setup needed!
